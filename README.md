For my senior project my goal is to develop a GameBoy game
based on [Kobayashi Takiji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takiji_Kobayashi)'s
novel, [*Kani Kousen*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kani_K%C5%8Dsen) (*蟹工船*) or *The Crab Cannery Ship.* 
Given this is a Computer Science and Japanese Language & Literature joint major,
the primary interest from the aspect of Japanese Language & Lit.
is looking at the particular ways in which a video game
interpretation of a novel is capable of telling a story.
For the Computer Science aspect I'm looking to add internet
connectivity to my GameBoy via the game cartridge.
Hopefully this game will be able to be accessed
from any GameBoy && person with the "smart" cartridge on this website here.

In the months leading up to the fall semester of 2018 I've been preparing 
by looking at the narrative structure of notable nintendo games; such as 
Final Fantasy, and most notably, Dragon Quest. Drawing on this research I 
hope to better inform my own ability to tell a story using this unique medium.
This essay located [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9o0-nqRyNwnV0R5c2E3bXBjSzNJWTNQN00tS2FGOHpCc1JR/view?usp=sharing) is particularly interesting (if you can 
read Japanese) because of its evaluation of the game Dragon Quest III as a 
candidate for a Sci-fi award. Looking into the kind of development tools 
that will come in handy for programming a GameBoy game has also been a part 
of the research leading up to this point. 

## Installing and Downloading Beta Game ##
I've just decided that if one *truly* feels compelled to download a copy of this
game in its current form, I may as well let them. Here's how it's done:

**Step 1: Download the ZIP**

There is a file on this page called 'kani_kousen_dwnld.zip'; go to this page, and click 'View Raw'

**Step 2: Unzip the ZIP**

Depending on your operating system this may work differently, but it should be pretty
simple to unzip (decompress or extract) the file, which should be in your Downloads folder.
In linux it's a command like:
	cd ~/Downloads; unzip *.zip

**Step 3: Download and emulator**

You'll want to download an emulator to play the gameboy game on your
computer. I would recommend bgb, which you can find [here](http://bgb.bircd.org/). 
There are many other options as well, you can find those options 
[here](https://github.com/gbdev/awesome-gbdev#emulators). 

**Step 4: Enjoy!**

Regardless of what emulator you choose, read its documentation to figure out how to 
properly Download it, and play games on it. 

### Quick TODO-List: ###
* use sprite positions in level 2
* make animation of fisherman walking away
* follow fisherman upstairs. (should we make door a ladder?)
* begin adding texture to "shit-pot" background
* jump into working mini-game
	* when beaten storm comes
* if you talk to the right person, you hear that a ship has gone missing
* go to bed
* wake up, and level 3 starts
