For my senior project my goal is to develop a GameBoy game
based on [Kobayashi Takiji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takiji_Kobayashi)'s
novel, [*Kani Kousen*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kani_K%C5%8Dsen) (*蟹工船*) or *The Crab Cannery Ship.* 
Given this is a Computer Science and Japanese Language & Literature joint major,
the primary interest from the aspect of Japanese Language & Lit.
is looking at the particular ways in which a video game
interpretation of a novel is capable of telling a story.
For the Computer Science aspect I'm looking to add internet
connectivity to my GameBoy via the game cartridge.
Hopefully this game will be able to be accessed
from any GameBoy && person with the "smart" cartridge on this website here.

In the months leading up to the fall semester of 2018 I've been preparing 
by looking at the narrative structure of notable nintendo games; such as 
Final Fantasy, and most notably, Dragon Quest. Drawing on this research I 
hope to better inform my own ability to tell a story using this unique medium.
This essay located [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9o0-nqRyNwnV0R5c2E3bXBjSzNJWTNQN00tS2FGOHpCc1JR/view?usp=sharing) is particularly interesting (if you can 
read Japanese) because of its evaluation of the game Dragon Quest III as a 
candidate for a Sci-fi award. Looking into the kind of development tools 
that will come in handy for programming a GameBoy game has also been a part 
of the research leading up to this point. 

## Playing the Game 
The original game website has been archived below. However, for easier access I'll
add the needed links and instructions here:
1. [Download Game](https://web.archive.org/web/20201002145336/http://toastergames.org/game/kani_kousen.gb)
2. [Open online GameBoy Emulator](https://taisel.github.io/GameBoy-Online/)
3. In emulator tab, click __File &rarr; Open As &rarr; Local File__
4. Upload the downloaded `kani_kousen.gb` file from step 1 &uarr;.
5. Enjoy!
   
### Game Controls:
```
GameBoy | Keyboard
--------+---------
      A | j
      B | y
```
Arrow keys control movement. Some Hints for Game Play: This game is text based, and relies on the main characters interaction with other characters in the game. You may have to talk to people then go to sleep in a certain order so that you can advance to the next level.

  If you get really stuck on the crab catching (as many have), use the net to catch the crab before hitting it.
