For my senior project my goal is to develop a GameBoy game
based on [Kobayashi Takiji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takiji_Kobayashi)'s novel, *[Kani Kousen]* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kani_K%C5%8Dsen) (*蟹工船*) or *The Crab Cannery Ship.* 
Given this is a Computer Science and Japanese Language & Literature joint major,
the primary interest from the aspect of Japanese Language & Lit.
is looking at the particular ways in which a video game
interpretation of a novel is capable of telling a story.
For the Computer Science aspect I'm looking to add internet
connectivity to my GameBoy via the game cartridge.
Hopefully this game will be able to be accessed
from any GameBoy && person with the "smart" cartridge on this website here.

In the months leading up to the fall semester of 2018 I've been preparing 
by looking at the narrative structure of notable nintendo games; such as 
Final Fantasy, and most notably, Dragon Quest. Drawing on this research I 
hope to better inform my own ability to tell a story using this unique medium.
This essay located [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9o0-nqRyNwnV0R5c2E3bXBjSzNJWTNQN00tS2FGOHpCc1JR/view?usp=sharing) is particularly interesting (if you can 
read Japanese) because of its evaluation of the game Dragon Quest III as a 
candidate for a Sci-fi award. Looking into the kind of development tools 
that will come in handy for programming a GameBoy game has also been a part 
of the research leading up to this point.
